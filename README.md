"We Do List" is a collaborative task management platform designed to help groups of people coordinate and manage tasks efficiently. Whether it's a project team, a household, a club, or any group with shared responsibilities, this platform will provide a centralized hub for task organization, delegation, tracking, and communication. Users can create and manage tasks, assign them to friends, set deadlines, and monitor progress while fostering effective collaboration.
