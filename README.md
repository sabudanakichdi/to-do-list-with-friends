# We Do List
To-Do List App - With Friends

## Project Overview
"We Do List" is a collaborative task management platform designed to help groups of people coordinate and manage tasks efficiently. Whether it's a project team, a household, a club, or any group with shared responsibilities, this platform will provide a centralized hub for task organization, delegation, tracking, and communication. Users can create and manage tasks, assign them to friends, set deadlines, and monitor progress, all while fostering effective collaboration.

## Roles

The roles vary for each type of product and, for small project teams, folks will serve multiple roles.  Provide first names of the individuals that will take on each role.  This is a list of common roles:

- Project Lead:
- Project Manager:
- Development Lead:
- Architect:
- Developers:
- DevOps lead:
- Test Lead:
- UX Designer:
- Risk Management:
- Requirements Engineer:

## Mission Statement:
> "Our mission is to simplify task management and enhance collaboration within groups by providing a user-friendly and feature-rich platform. We aim to help friends and communities organize their work, improve productivity, and achieve their goals together."

## Communications Plan

### Working team meetings
These meetings form the core of the team’s collaboration and can be used for brainstorming, pair-programming, debugging, prototyping, internal reviews of each other’s work, etc.  Except for the weekly status meetings, these are done without the manager’s (the instructor) involvement.   Often it can be done by the team during the time of the scheduled class while other teams are having status meetings, but this may not be convenient if the team is a hybrid mix where some members are on campus while others are remote.   

Whether you have your working meetings during class time or not, each team should also agree upon some recurring time(s) when to meet to work as a group in case it is needed.   State here what has been agreed upon for the working team meetings.

### Issues meetings
If a problem does arise, never surprise your manager.  Schedule a meeting at his or her earliest convenience.  This section describes how alerts will arise and the governance of when to trigger an alert – usually after a discussion at a working team meeting.

### Status meetings
Status meetings are meetings where the project manager and/or project leader reports on status to the instructor.   These will occur weekly over the duration of the project during scheduled class time with the entire team present so they can all speak to any questions of status to the instructor.

## Timeline and Milestones
Look forward for the next 10 to 13 weeks and plan out a set of target milestones (estimated) that the team expects to meet over the duration of the project, culminating in the final presentation at the end of the semester.

## Risks
Describe any risks that you see for this project, and how they will be track and monitored.

## Assumptions 
State any assumptions you have about this project.

## Proposed Tech Stack:
To build "We Do List," we'll utilize the following technology stack:
-	MERN Stack:
	- MongoDB: For storing task data and user information.
	- Express.js: To create the backend API and handle routing.
	- React.js: To develop the frontend user interface.
	- Node.js: For server-side scripting and application logic.
-	Project Management:
	- JIRA: To track User Stories and project velocity through out 4 sprints.
-	Azure Cloud Services:
	- Azure App Service: To host the web application and backend server.
	- Azure Active Directory: For user authentication and authorization.
	- Azure Functions: For serverless functionality, such as email notifications or background tasks.
	- Azure DevOps: For CI/CD pipelines and project management.
 - 	Codacy: Code Coverage and Quality
